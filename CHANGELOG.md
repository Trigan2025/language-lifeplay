## 0.1.3 - Some fixes

- Extend the number of tokens per line to 500.
- Fix the ElseIf not decreasing the indentation.
- Add with what prefix comments should be toggled.
- Add a snippet variant of ACTION that includes the WHO label for interactions.  
    *And I was wrong concerning the WHO label in a lpaction file as being not documented, as the documentation does in fact mention it at least in the getTarget.txt file.*
- Fix the character escaping in strings.
- Fix how the close parenthesis is catch.
    *Previously, if you tried to adds bundled parenthesis, it will have made the editor lag a second or so.*
- And the content-name for fenceless-strings *(quote-less strings)*
