## 0.1.1 - Small patch

- I found out afterward while looking in an lpaction file of an official mod that the WHO label were in use (though not mentioned in the documentation), so this patch adds its support for these files.
- I also taked the opportunity to separate more clearly the EFFECTS and CONDITIONS lines and added IS\_MALE in the condition keyword list (also not mentioned in the documentation, but itâ€™s an obvious one though).

*Well, the documentation are clearly outdated anyway on some topics.*
